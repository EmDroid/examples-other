CUDA MatrixMul
==============

Multiplication of square matrices with CUDA.
Using texture units to speedup access to graphic card memory.

Win32 build in the release subdir (launch from command line to see the results).

CUDA toolkit does not need to be installed (cudart.dll is in the dir), only the NVidia driver
has to meet the minimal version as described in the ReadMe.txt.
